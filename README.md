The extensions should then appear on the 'Extenssions' page in Rancher Manager.

There are a number of buttons:

- Clear All - will remove all notificatiopns
- Add Test Notifications - will add a set of test notifications
- Start update of progress ... - will start a timer that increases the progress of the task notification. Note: This onlty works once the 'Add Test Notifications' button has been clicked - this button will update the progress notification added by it.
- Reset release notes read status - If you clear all notifications, you won't get back the Release Notes notification, as its read status is recorded in a user preference. This button will reset that user preference, so if you clear all notifications, click this button and refresh the browser, the release notes notification should be re-added
- Add a test Growl - adds a growl, which will also show up as a notification
